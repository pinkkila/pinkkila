## Hi, I’m Petteri!

I study software development at Haaga-Helia with a focus on full-stack web development. My main stack in my studies has been **Spring Boot** on the backend and **React** on the frontend. I also have hands-on experience with **AWS**, **Linux system administration**, and a strong interest in **application security**.

Currently, I’m building my [pinkkstore](https://github.com/pinkkila/pinkkstore) project, which also forms the foundation of my thesis.
